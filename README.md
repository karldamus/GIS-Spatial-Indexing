# Comparing the Cost and Efficiency of Nearest Neighbour Search in K-d Trees versus R-Trees
## Project Description:

Testing the performance of R-Trees and KD-Trees, different spatial indexing data structures for Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

# 1 Abstract

Querying spatial data is one of the most important elements of working with a Geographic Information System (GIS). Being able to execute queries on a GIS data structure efficiently and accurately has a tremendous impact on how useful or unuseful your GIS is. Because a GIS has a vast number of applications in the real world including, but not limited to, urban planning, weather forecasting, and agriculture, there are consequences to an inefficient GIS due to your data structures not being able to execute queries in a timely manner. This paper aims to assess the capabilities of R-trees and K-d trees when being used for finding a nearest neighbour. Through analysis and a comparative study, I will identify which data structure is better suited for this specific task.
